# General
This is an open source, Javascript game using Kontra.js  
Main gameplay is focused on a roller-coaster system, on which the player will play with acceleration and brakes, both of which use a certain amount of limited resources.  
There will be multiple levels, of different diffculty levels and style, and a vague storyline that drives the gameplay.  
  
# Physical System  
//no class allowed  
{ddx, ddy} getAcceleration( {conditions} )  
    conditions:  
        - slope  
        - current speed  
    intended effects:  
        - slow down on a uphill  
        - speed up on downhill  
        - maintain/tiny slow down on plain terrain  
        - jump and gravity:  
            . gravity downward (how to explain?)  
            . gravity magnitude: ???  
            . jump when there is gravity and running over a gap  
            . zero gravity zone in some levels
